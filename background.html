  <div class="photo-section">
    <img src="H8.jpg" alt="Childhood">
    <p>My name is Muhammad Nur Hakimi Bin Noor Azman. I'm 21 years old and I live in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur. I have 2 siblings and i'm the youngest one.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="photo-section">
    <img src="F1.jpg" alt="Family">
    <p>My supportive family <3 I’m incredibly grateful to be surrounded by a family whose love and support have shaped who I am. Through every challenge and triumph, they've stood by me not just with words, but with actions that speak volumes. My parents have been my foundation, always believing in me, even when I doubted myself. My siblings have been my friends, cheerleaders, and sometimes even my teachers. In a world that can feel uncertain, my family has been my constant source of strength, understanding, and unconditional love. I know I wouldn't be where I am today without them, and I carry their support with me in everything I do.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="photo-section">
    <img src="LF2.jpg" alt="Life Moment">
    <p>This is a picture full of memories where my family and I performed Umrah together. It was also my father's dream to bring the family to the holy land of Mecca.</p>
